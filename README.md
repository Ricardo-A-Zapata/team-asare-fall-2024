This repository serves as our Flask api backend for our FullStack journal SWE project. Our Frontend will soon be available, which will send http requests to our [endpoints] (server/endpoints.py).

For a better understanding of our user requirements and accomplishments throughout this project, please refer to [this file] (docs/ProgressAndGoals.md)

To build production, type `make prod`.

To create the env for a new developer, run `make dev_env`.
